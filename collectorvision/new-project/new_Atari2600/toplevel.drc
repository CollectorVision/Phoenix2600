WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net
   a2601Instance/ms_A2601/tia_inst/phi0 is sourced by a combinatorial pin. This
   is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to control the loading of data
   into the flip-flop.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net
   a2601Instance/ms_A2601/tia_inst/vid_clk_dvdr<3> is sourced by a combinatorial
   pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to control the loading
   of data into the flip-flop.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net
   host_reset_n_host_debug_arm_AND_1927_o is sourced by a combinatorial pin.
   This is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to control the loading of
   data into the flip-flop.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:367 - The signal <Mram_debug_mem3_RAMD_D1_O> is
   incomplete. The signal does not drive any load pins in the design.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:367 - The signal <Mram_debug_mem5_RAMD_D1_O> is
   incomplete. The signal does not drive any load pins in the design.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:367 - The signal <Mram_debug_mem4_RAMD_D1_O> is
   incomplete. The signal does not drive any load pins in the design.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:367 - The signal <Mram_debug_mem2_RAMD_D1_O> is
   incomplete. The signal does not drive any load pins in the design.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:367 - The signal <Mram_debug_mem1_RAMD_D1_O> is
   incomplete. The signal does not drive any load pins in the design.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:781 - PULLUP on an active net. PULLUP of comp
   joy2_p1_i_PULLUP is set but the tri state is not configured. 
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:781 - PULLUP on an active net. PULLUP of comp
   joy2_p4_i_PULLUP is set but the tri state is not configured. 
INFO:PhysDesignRules:1861 - To achieve optimal frequency synthesis performance
   with the CLKFX and CLKFX180 outputs of the DCM comp
   pll_575_instance/dcm_sp_inst, consult the device Data Sheet.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:2410 - This design is using one or more 9K Block RAMs
   (RAMB8BWER).  9K Block RAM initialization data, both user defined and
   default, may be incorrect and should not be used.  For more information,
   please reference Xilinx Answer Record 39999.
DRC detected 0 errors and 11 warnings.  Please see the previously displayed
individual error or warning messages for more details.
